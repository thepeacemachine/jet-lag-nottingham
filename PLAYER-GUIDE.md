## 🔍 Seeker Quick Reference

### Your Question Cards:

| Card | Uses | What It Does |
|------|------|--------------|
| 🔵 MATCHING | 3 | "Is your nearest X same as mine?" |
| 🟢 MEASURING | 3 | "Are you closer to X than me?" |
| 🟠 RADAR | 2 | "Are you within X miles?" |
| 🟡 THERMOMETER | 2 | Move 100m, get warmer/colder |
| 🔷 PHOTO | 1 | "Send photo of X" |

### Strategy Tips:
- Start with RADAR (wide search)
- Use MEASURING for direction
- Save PHOTO for confirmation
- THERMOMETER works best when close
- Work together (or don't, if on different teams!)

### Important:
- Each question used = gone forever
- Hider draws a card after each question
- Hider can VETO your question (you lose it!)

## 📍 GPS & Map Guide

### What You See:
- **Red marker** = Hider location

- ✅ You see ALL seekers

**If you're a Seeker (4 players):**

**If you're a Seeker (5 players - teams):**

### GPS Tips:
- Works best outdoors
